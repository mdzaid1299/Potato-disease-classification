# Plant Disease Classification using CNN

![Sample Prediction](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a548fb8d-2977-47ac-925a-8290b1bc64a0)


## Overview

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify plant diseases from images. The model is trained on the **PlantVillage** dataset and can accurately predict whether a plant is healthy or diseased. The model achieves [insert accuracy] on the test dataset after being trained for 30 epochs.

## Features

- Image classification using CNN architecture.
- Data augmentation to improve model generalization.
- Visualizations of training progress and predictions.
- Saved model for future use.

Download the PlantVillage dataset and place it in the `PlantVillage/` directory.

### Sample Prediction

Hereâ€™s a sample prediction generated by the model:

![Prediction](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d85d4cb4-3837-46cd-8dd6-ded43206af4b)

The model predicts the class of the plant leaf with high confidence.

## Model Architecture

The model consists of the following layers:

- Input layer to accept image input.
- Multiple Convolutional and MaxPooling layers.
- Fully connected Dense layers.
- Output layer with softmax activation for classification.
